# Indian restaurant using Tailwindcss
Website for a fake franchise of restaurants.
## Welcome
Homepage of the website. Also used to show promotions and events.
## Menu
Simple menu of our proposed dishes at the restaurant <br>
It could be bigger, i'll change it if i dont take to much (more) time on the deployment 
## Gallery
Gallery of a few pictures of the "restaurant" <br>
First thing i'll change if i get some time left
## About us
A simple page where the history of the restaurant and the available locations are shown.
## Contact
Contact form used to send messages to the restaurant. A few subjects can be chosen
## Possible improvements
I'm not satisfied by the overall style of the website. I had a few problems setting up the work environment (vite + tailwindcss) and now i got problems to deploy the website. I would have liked to be able to work more on the website.
